# dekube-provider-simple-workload

Simple workload provider for [dekube](https://dekube.io) — converts Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, and Job manifests into compose services. Naively maps each workload to a compose service without attempting to emulate scheduling, scaling, or lifecycle management.

**The Builder** — one of the Eight Monks, the founding extensions of the helmfile2compose distribution.

> Heresy level: 7/10 — flattens an entire orchestration plane into flat services. The most dangerous rite in the canon.
